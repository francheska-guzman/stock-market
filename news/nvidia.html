<p class="information">
At the Game Developers Conference on Feb. 28, NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) announced the new GeForce GTX 1080 Ti graphics processor, which the company touted as its fastest gaming GPU ever.
<br/><br/>
The power of TITAN X for about half the price
NVIDIA claims the GTX 1080 Ti is 35% faster than the TITAN X Pascal-based GPU, which is used for deep learning and artificial intelligence. It's priced at $699 -- about half the cost of the TITAN X's $1,200 price tag.
<br/><br/>
One way NVIDIA is able to design its latest gaming GPUs to run faster than TITAN X is through advanced cooling solutions, which allows the GTX 1080 Ti, for example, to run at higher clock speeds while dissipating heat more efficiently.
<br/><br/>
The GTX 1080 Ti packs plenty of horsepower to run the latest games smoothly on 4K and 5K resolution displays. The new graphics card was also designed to power virtual reality (VR) games. It is important for NVIDIA to hold its lead in being the card of choice for gamers, because gaming is NVIDIA's largest revenue category. 
<br/><br/>
The Pascal upgrade cycle is under way
NVIDIA's gaming revenue grew 44% in fiscal 2017 to $4.06 billion, fueled by gamer adoption of new GPUs that feature the latest Pascal card design. Strong demand should continue, as the majority of PC gamers have not upgraded to a Pascal GPU yet. According to CEO Jen-Hsun Huang, NVIDIA has an installed GeForce user base of "a couple of 100 million." As to how far along in the upgrade cycle those users are, he said:
</p>
<p class="quote">
"We've upgraded about two quarters of them, as in two operating quarters out of four years. It takes about three to four years to upgrade the entire installed base. And we started ramping Pascal, as you know, a few quarters ago. And our data would suggest that the upgrade cycle is going well, and we have plenty to go."
</p>
<p class="information">
Gamers are enthusiastic to get their hands on the $700 GTX 1080 Ti; it sold out quickly on NVIDIA's website. Valve Corporation's recent Steam Hardware Survey updated for February shows gamers rapidly adopting Pascal-based GPUs such as the GTX 1070 and GTX 1060. Steam is one of the most popular PC gaming distribution platforms.
<br/><br/>
The launch of the new GTX 1080 Ti at the $699 price point allowed the company to lower the price of the GTX 1080 by $100, which should assist the upgrade cycle and could help the company hold its top market share position.
