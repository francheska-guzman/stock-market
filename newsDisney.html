<p class="information">
Be our guest, indeed.
<br/><br/>
Director Bill Condon's Beauty and the Beast opened over the weekend to a monstrous $170 million from 4,210 theaters at the North American box office. Overseas, the female-fueled update of the classic 1991 animated musical also dazzled, earning $180 million for an elegant global bow of $350 million.
<br/><br/>
Beauty set a number of new records, including the biggest start ever for a PG title both in North America and abroad (last year's Finding Dory was the previous champ domestically with $135 million). And it surpassed the $166 million domestic debut of last year's Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice to land the top March opening of all time. Just as impressive, the family-friendly movie boasts the seventh-biggest domestic opening for any film, and the biggest outside of summer save for December 2015 bow of fellow Disney blockbuster Star Wars: The Force Awakens, not accounting for inflation.
<br/><br/>
Several rival studios have Beauty and the Beast coming in higher ($173 million-$174 million); a final figure will be released by Disney on Monday. Either way, it will be the largest domestic opening since Marvel/Disney's Captain America: Civil War ($177 million) almost a year ago.
<br/><br/>
Internationally, Beauty placed No. 1 almost everywhere. It was huge in the U.K. with $22.8 million - one of the top five openings ever there - and impressed in China with $44.8 million, already topping the entire runs of Maleficent and Alice in Wonderland.
<br/><br/>
The $160 million tentpole is yet another win for Disney, where studio chairman Alan Horn â€” who worked with British star Emma Watson on the Harry Potter franchise when running Warner Bros. - and production chief Sean Bailey have been intent on mining the studio's classic animated vault and building a stable of live-action movies. Past hits include The Jungle Book, Maleficent, Cinderella and Alice in Wonderland.
<br/><br/>
The tale follows the bookish Belle, who attempts to rescue her father from the castle of a terrifying beast, and instead becomes his captor. But she soon starts to fall for the Beast and the enchanted staff of his castle, who were all put under a spell by a witch.
<br/><br/>
The film saw a nice boost from a full run in Imax theaters, generally known as a haven for fanboys. But with PG films booming, Imax is expanding its programming to include family-friendly fare. The large-screen exhibitor worked with Condon on making a special version of Beauty that allows more to be seen on the screen because of a different aspect ratio. Also, Imax offered a 2D version of the movie throughout the day so that it would be a more affordable outing for families. The scheme worked, with Imax locations contributing $12.5 million in North America and $21 million worldwide, beating Jungle Book ($18 million) for the top PG title.
